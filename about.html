            <p class="review-text">From the moment you walk up the stairs to La Sosta you are greeted with a traditional Buona Sera, which warmed my heart immediately! Taken to our seats and offered water and a drinks menu. Then the food!!! Absolutely amazing. We shared 4 antipasto for entrees. Delicious calamari, capressio, croquettes and chorizo. Then our mains, my husband thoroughly enjoyed his risotto and I was over the moon with my pizzoccheri (a traditional dish from the Valtellina area). Desserts that followed were equally as good. Definitely be going back to this wonderful place. Great for couples or a big group.</p>
